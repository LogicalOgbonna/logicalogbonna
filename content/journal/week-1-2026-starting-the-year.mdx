Started the year with a list of goals. Checked them against last year's list.

80% were the same.

Not because they're timeless priorities — because I never actually committed to them. They were ambient aspirations. Things I thought I *should* want.

## The pattern I noticed

Most of my "goals" were:
- Externally legible (looks good on a resume)
- Vaguely defined (learn X, improve Y)
- Not connected to anything I actually care about

I was optimizing for how my year would *look* in retrospect, not how it would *feel* while living it.

## What I'm changing

Three questions for any goal:

1. Would I pursue this if no one ever knew?
2. What does "done" actually look like?
3. What am I willing to give up for it?

If I can't answer all three, it's not a goal. It's a wish.

## This year's theme

**Depth over breadth.**

Fewer projects. More focus.
Fewer tools. More mastery.
Fewer opinions. More understanding.

This site is the first test. One thing, done properly, for the whole year.
