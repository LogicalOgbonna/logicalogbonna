This week reminded me that not all progress feels productive.

I shipped less code, but made better decisions.
Said no to distractions.
Re-read old notes and noticed repeating patterns.

The real work was choosing what *not* to do.

## What I worked on

Spent most of the week refactoring a legacy service that's been causing issues for months. No new features, just cleaning up tech debt. The kind of work that doesn't show up in sprint demos but makes everything else easier.

## What I learned

- Saying "not yet" is different from saying "no"
- Most urgent things aren't important
- Writing down decisions prevents re-litigating them later

## Next week

Focus on the system design prep I've been putting off. Also need to start outlining that essay on testing philosophy.
