Had a moment this week where my experience almost hurt me.

A junior engineer proposed a solution I immediately dismissed. Too simple. Couldn't possibly scale. I'd seen this pattern fail before.

Except I hadn't. I'd seen *similar* patterns fail in *different* contexts. I was pattern-matching on surface features, not underlying constraints.

Their solution shipped. It worked. It was better than what I would have built.

## The uncomfortable truth

Seniority isn't just about knowing more. It's about knowing when your knowledge doesn't apply.

The more patterns you've seen, the easier it is to see patterns that aren't there.

## What I'm sitting with

- When did I last let a junior engineer change my mind?
- How many "obvious" decisions have I made on autopilot?
- What would I build differently if I had to explain every choice?

## The habit I'm testing

Before dismissing an idea: "What would have to be true for this to be the right answer?"

Not "why won't this work?" but "under what conditions would this work?"

Different question. Different posture.
