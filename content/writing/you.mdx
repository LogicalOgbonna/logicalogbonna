I don't care about a fancy car,
Unless it's taking me to you.

I don't like long journies,
Not when it's leading me to you.

I don't care about how stressful the journey might be,
I know you will always come through.

I don't like how bad I feel the following day after a journey,
Not when I'm waking up next to you.

I can go through all this for only one person,
You know it's you.
