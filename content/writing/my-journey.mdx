As I walk through the path that I was told;
The path followed by men of old;
The end indeed is full of gold,
But the path to me seems too cold.

It requires some personalities that I need to mold,
Courage, knowledge, persistence, and self-control,
It is not the type of journey that I bargained for because I thought it would be a stroll,
But I encountered experiences that made my head roll.

So I had to put myself back in one fold,
Realizing that not just determination is key,
But also having someone whose hands I hold;
While I pass through the huddles filled on this road.

The road to success is full of distractions,
Especially in a 21st-century nation,
Where people do things without caution,
Making it hard for me to find my direction.

As a young man, I am faced with constraints ranging from time to information,
And that is the main reason why I need a mentor,
Who will be an instructor, an advisor, and my tutor?
