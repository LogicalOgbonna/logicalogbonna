The age I made the most mistakes,
The age I went all in, putting everything at stake,
The age I felt so much alive and awake.
The age was 23.

The age nothing made sense,
The age most of my actions had no essence,
At this age, the only thing that kept me was persistence.
The age was 23.

The age I lost what I never knew I had,
The age I never admitted most of my habits were bad,
The age where my actions never left me sad,
The age was 23.

The age I knew a friend was everything,
The age I had the least friends(1); for me, HE could do anything,
The age I found happiness, the knowledge that FAMILY is EVERYTHING,
The age was 23.

Welcome to 24
