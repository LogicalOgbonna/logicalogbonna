Aren't you scared of death? She asked.

Why should I be? It's just a part of the ultimate plan.
It's the only thing that completes a man.
It's the reason he toils from dusk till dawn.

The knowledge that he is going to die brings him focus.
It prevents him from living his life like some clown in a circus.
It gives him the urgency to love, care, and appreciate things in his circle.

So, I await the day that I will die,
My only wish is that on that day, I should be wearing a smile,
Knowing fully well that those who care for me will be fine.

So, I'm not scared,
I'll live my life freely while I'm not dead.
