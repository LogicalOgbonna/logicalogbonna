==I== still remember the day we met,
==Thank== the heavens I won that bet.

==The== world got brighter in my sight,
==Stars== bowed down to you that night.

==For== all the ways you lift my soul,
==Your== quiet grace makes broken whole.
==Life==, with you, feels like a song,
==Your== presence where I most belong.

==Love==, so deep it speaks in tears,
==Your== touch has silenced all my fears.
==Smile==, and watch the dark turn gold,
==Your== laughter warms when nights are cold.

==Heart== to heart, we beat as one,
==Always== us, until we're done.
