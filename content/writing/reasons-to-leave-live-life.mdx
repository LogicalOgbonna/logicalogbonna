Every day, I'm faced with a dilemma,
Living life, to me, is like solving an enigma.
No matter how hard I think, I still can't think past this trauma,
It's so unfortunate that I can't question most dogmas.

I and everything I care about will one day cease to exist.
Why keep living if the end is pain I can't resist?
Even though I die, in my loved ones, this pain persists.
Reason to leave life, since I'm no optimist.

I know the end, my destiny, which is death,
I know I will lose everything. It was clear since my birth.
Isn't that much of a reason to cherish every moment?
Making the most of it since you know it isn't permanent.

My dilemma is either leave or live life,
Either see life from the lens of an optimist,
Or from that of a pessimist.
I don't think a wrong answer exists.
