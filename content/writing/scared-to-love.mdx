Are you scared to love? She asked.

Fear is a by-product of ignorance,
A feeling that you might lose something of importance.

What else can I lose?
Definitely, I will forget it over a bottle or two of booze.

Even with great caution,
immeasurable are the things I have lost.
That's why when I love, I do so without fear of what it may cost.

Nature will take its course anyway.
We will lose everything, including ourselves, on the way.

So, I am not scared.
I will always love while I'm not dead.
