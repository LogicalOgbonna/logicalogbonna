hang in there...,

a calm voice echoed, followed by a gentle tap on my shoulder.
as she passed by me gently, yet again, she said, Hang in there.

i know how this is going to end, I thought to myself,
immediately, the ceiling fan above starts making creaking sounds,
the support on my feet fell off, and I could feel my feet dangle.

the weight of my entire body was resting on my neck,
which was held in place by a rope tied to the ceiling fan.
my eyes wide open, yet sight made no sense.
my lungs gasped for air, but my tightening neck denied it.

right before losing consciousness, a familiar, gentle voice whispers,
i'm here to help you, putting support on my feet, patting my shoulders,
'you've got this'; she's gone before I could make sense of my sight.

before I could take the rope off my neck, a calm voice echoed,
followed by a gentle tap on my shoulder... hang in there.

The loop continues...
