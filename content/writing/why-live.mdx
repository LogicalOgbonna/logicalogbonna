What is it with life that humans cling to it so dearly?
I asked her, with my eyes very teary.

It is pretty expensive, you know.
A lot of people living, steal from others to make sure they keep living,
While some sell parts of their living body to ensure other parts' survival.
Others will have to take the lives of others struggling to live for them to live.

It's also frustrating, you know.
Nobody tells you how to live this said life.
And everyone expects you to have your shits in order.
And it gets even worse, your friends (mates) lives all seem to be in order.

Why still struggle to live?
Why would anyone want to keep living in a world so chaotic?
You are battling diabetes and obesity; the healthcare system is epileptic.
You ate those diseases with your mouth to ensure another man's survival.

I know what you are thinking; I'm not suicidal.
I'm not brave enough to bear such a huge responsibility.
I failed both times I tried. Every cell in my body wanted to live.
I will look for something to blame instead (Natural cause).

She still didn't utter a word; she kept staring at me.
I will leave now; I don't know where to, but I promise I will be back.
