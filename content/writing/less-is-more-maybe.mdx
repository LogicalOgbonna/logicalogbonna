Maybe I should settle for less.
I'm sure this will help reduce the stress.
It will surely increase the time I have for family and friends.

The more I strive to possess things.
The more I strive to possess even more things.
The joy of having the first seizes when I realize I can possess even more.

This circle continues with no end in mind.
When will I possess the last thing that will bring peace of mind?
There is always this feeling that there is that one thing I still need to find.

Maybe less is more.
Maybe I may have to possess less and experience more.
I won't have to bother about what I will do with the excess anymore.
