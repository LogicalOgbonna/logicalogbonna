When I saw you first, it took all of me not to kiss you.
All I wanted was a chance to be with you.

When you smiled at me,
All I wanted was to ask if you would run away with me.

When our eyes locked,
I felt calm and stood still as a ship docked.

To be frank, I was at a loss for words,
Seeing the full extent of God's handwork.

I can't change water into wine,
But if you give me a chance, I will make you mine.
