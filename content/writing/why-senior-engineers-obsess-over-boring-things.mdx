Early in my career, I wanted to work on the exciting stuff. New features. Greenfield projects. The latest framework.

Now, years later, I find myself obsessing over things that would have bored me to death back then:

- Error handling
- Logging
- Documentation
- Test coverage
- Deployment pipelines
- RFCs

What changed?

## Experience is a harsh teacher

I've seen what happens when you skip the "boring" parts:

- **Missing error handling** → 3am pages and angry customers
- **Poor logging** → Hours of detective work during incidents
- **No documentation** → The same questions asked over and over
- **Flaky tests** → Nobody trusts the CI, so nobody runs it
- **Manual deployments** → Fear of releasing, features stuck in limbo
- **Skipping RFCs** → Big decisions made in silos, costly rework when reality hits

The exciting work creates value. The boring work protects it.

## Boring is a feature

Senior engineers know something junior engineers haven't learned yet: **boring is good**.

Boring means predictable. Predictable means reliable. Reliable means you can sleep at night.

The flashy new architecture that nobody understands? That's not sophisticated—it's a liability. The simple, well-tested system that "just works"? That's engineering.

## What I look for now

When I evaluate code, systems, or even job opportunities, I ask:

1. How do they handle errors?
2. What happens when something goes wrong at 2am?
3. Can a new engineer understand this in a week?
4. Is there a deployment process, or just vibes?
5. Do they write RFCs before building big things, or just wing it?

The answers tell me more about engineering maturity than any tech stack ever could.

## The unsexy truth

Building software that lasts requires caring about things that don't make good Twitter posts.

Nobody's going viral for their comprehensive logging strategy. But when the system stays up during a traffic spike, when bugs get caught before production, when new team members ramp up quickly—that's the work paying off.

Obsess over the boring things. Your future self will thank you.
