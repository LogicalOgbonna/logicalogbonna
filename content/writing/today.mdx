How was today? She asked

Of all my days, today is the worst.
I spent most of it thinking about tomorrow,
And the rest was spent reminiscing about yesterday.

When tomorrow comes, it becomes today, and today, yesterday.
I might feel the same way tomorrow.
The cycle continues for the worst.

I hear people say, "live in the now.", not realizing that's a luxury to most.
Not when success and happiness don't have a goalpost.

Do you think there kept shifting? No, there was never a goalpost.
